# messenger-rust

A client/server messaging service for Linux, built in Rust

## Intention

This is a toy project to demonstrate client-server messaging via Rust, as a rewrite of a school project.  Partly done as an exercise in learning Rust, partly done to relearn what I'd learned before.

## Building messenger_server and messenger_client

After untaring the project, use:

TODO: make sure this works for multiple workspaces
```
cargo build
```

This will install the server and clients to the current directory.  Both projects can also be built individually with:

```
